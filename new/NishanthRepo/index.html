            The BMC said Mumbai has recorded over 300 mm of rainfall at various places in six hours from 1am to 7am on
            Monday.
            Mumbai, the financial capital of India, and its suburbs experienced heavy overnight rainfall, resulting in
            widespread waterlogging, diversion of BEST buses and cancellation of several trains on Monday, July 8.
            Suburban train services, especially those of the Central Railway, were running slowly.

            The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said Mumbai has recorded over 300 mm of rainfall at various
            places in six hours from 1am to 7am on Monday.
            Heavy rain in some low-lying areas led to waterlogging and disruption of suburban train services.
            The BMC said heavy rain is also expected on Monday.
            In order to avoid inconvenience to students, a holiday for the first session is declared for all BMC,
            government and private schools and colleges in Mumbai (BMC area). The decision for the next session will be
            announced after reviewing the situation, the BMC said.

            France's left-wing alliance on Sunday was set to get the most number of seats in a stunning reversal of
            fortunes for the bloc in the second round of the parliamentary polls, while the far-right that won the first
            round and was projected to win the elections was relegated to the third spot.

            President Emmanuel Macron's party is expected to finish second, but the country faces the prospect of a hung
            parliament after none of these groups secured a majority.

            The leftist alliance, comprising the hard left, Greens and Socialists, were on track to get 184-198 seats,
            according to polling agencies, which are generally accurate, but short of the majority mark of 289 in the
            577-seat National Assembly. Macron's centrist alliance were set to get between 160-169 seats while the
            far-right National Rally and its allies were expected to secure 135-143 seats.

            With the official results trickling in, riots broke out in Paris and other cities as left-wing supporters
            gathered in Place de la Republique to celebrate the alliance getting the plurality of seats.

            FRENCH PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS: THE LATEST
            Videos posted on social media showed police wearing riot gear confronting the demonstrators as teargas were
            released, and several protesters were arrested. The demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails on the roads,
            setting off smoke bombs, prompting clashes between them and the riot police.



            The left-wing bloc, called the Popular Front, comprises France's Socialist Party, the French Communist
            Party, a green political party called the Ecologists and France Unbowed. The parties forged an unlikely
            alliance in a bid to block the far-right from winning outright after the National Rally's stunning victory
            in the first round of elections.

            The left-wing bloc has promised to institute several measures, including scrapping Macron's pension reform
            and establishing a "right to retire" at 60 years, Fox News reported. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal
            said he would resign on Monday but would remain as caretaker prime minister until a new candidate was
            appointed to the post.

            The results were also a blow for Macron, who called the snap election, in a bid to re-establish his
            political dominance. But voters punished him and his alliance for a cost of living crisis and failing public
            services as the National Rally surged ahead in the first round. The far-right party had also won the
            European Parliament elections last month.

            The National Rally capitalised on the issues that French people were facing, shedding their historic
            reputation for racism and antisemitism, and spreading their appeal way beyond their traditional strongholds,
            but it was not enough to secure a victory. Despite the stunning defeat, party leader Marine Le Pen said the
            seeds had been sown for the future.
